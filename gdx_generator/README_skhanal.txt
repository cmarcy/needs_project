1. Run finalizing_outputs_needs.py file
2. Run csv2gdx_converter.gms files
3. Copy the ExistingUnits_EIA-NEMS.gdx, PrescriptiveBuilds_EIA-NEMS.gdx, PrescriptiveRetirements_EIA-NEMS.gdx,
   and ReEDS_generator_database_final_EIA-NEMS.csv files into your ReEDS directory and run!

When unit database is changed, this process has to be repeated to create new gdx files.
